minetest-turrent
================

Adopted an abandoned Minetest mod called Simple Turret
  
See https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?id=3836 for details on old mod

License: TBD (Original Unknown)

Please note that I am not overly interested in extending this mod but I may entertain minor tweaks or changing an image or two, if provided.

Tested: Minetest release 0.4.7 on Windows.

Dependencies: Just Default.

I may flesh out this file later on. I'm learning Lua so expect to see some formatting changes due to better formatting due to Style Guides.
